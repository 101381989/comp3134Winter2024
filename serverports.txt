1. What is the definition of server port?

 A port is a virtual place where network connections begin and stop. 
Ports are software-based and controlled by a computer's operating system. 
Each port is connected with a particular process or service. 
Ports enable computers to readily distinguish between various types of traffic. 
Emails, for example, use a different port than webpages, 
even though both reach a computer via the same Internet connection.

2. What is server port range?

The server port range is typically from 0 to 65535.

3.How many bits does number above represent?

The port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer,
 meaning it can represent values from 0 to 65535.
 This implies that 16 bits are used to encode the port number.
